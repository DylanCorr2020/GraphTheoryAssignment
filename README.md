This is my graph theory module assignment readme. It contains two jupyter notebooks that explains how graph thory can be applied to sorting elements in an array, and explaining the graph isomorphism problem.
## Heap Sort Notebook
This jupyter notebook explains how graph thory can be applied to sorting elements in an array. 
* Explanation of the Heap Sort algorithm
* Python function implementing Heap Sort.
* Explanation of the computational complexity of Heap Sort.
* Explanation of how graph theory is used in Heap Sort.
## Graph Isomorphism Problem Notebook
This jupyter notebook explains how graph thory can be applied to the Graph isomorphism problem.
* Explanation of the Graph Iomorphism Problem.
* Explanation of how graphs can be represented in data structures.
* Python function implementing an algorithm to determine if two graphs are isomorphic or not.
* Discussion of the computational complexity of the Graph Isomorphism Problem.


## Running Jupyter Notebooks
*Install Anaconda https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html
*Clone the repository use command git clone https://github.com/DylanCorr2020/GraphTheoryAssignment
*cd into GraphTheoryAssignment 
*Type in command jupyter notebook, select either Heap-Sort.ipynb or Graph-Isomorphism.ipynb
*Run all and restart the kernel


## Overview of Graph Theory 
## Introduction
In mathematics, graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. (Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory)
## Origins
Leonard Euler, while trying to solve the bridge problem, invented the ‘the geometry of position’. Today, this is known as the field of graph theory.
## The essence of a graph
Graph theory is the study of relationships or how things are connected.
A graph is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which are connected by edges (also called links or lines)
A distinction is made between undirected graphs, where edges link two vertices symmetrically, and directed graphs, where edges link two vertices asymmetrically

## Applications
## computer science 
* Graph theory is used for the study of algorithms.
* To define the flow of computation.
* To represent networks of communication.
* To represent data organisation.
* Find the shortest path or road in network.
* In Google Maps, various locations are represented as vertices or nodes and the roads are represented as edges and graph theory is used to find the shortest path   between two nodes.

## Other Applications
* Mathematics
* Social Networks 
* Biology
* Electrical Engineering
* Linguistics
* Chemistry 
* Physics
* .....
