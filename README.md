# Dylan Corr's Graph theory assigment github
This is my graph theory module assignment readme. It contains two jupyter notebooks that explains how graph thory can be applied to sorting elements in an array, and to the graph pomorphism problem.
## Heap Sort Notebook
This jupyter notebook explains how graph thory can be applied to sorting elements in an array. 
* Explanation of the Heap Sort algorithm
* Python function implementing Heap Sort.
* Explanation of the computational complexity of Heap Sort.
* Explanation of how graph theory is used in Heap Sort.
## Graph Isomorphism Problem Notebook
This jupyter notebook explains how graph thory can be applied to the Graph pomorphism problem.
* Explanation of the Graph Iomorphism Problem.
* Explanation of how graphs can be represented in data structures.
* Python function implementing an algorithm to determine if two graphs are isomorphic or not.
* Discussion of the computational complexity of the Graph Isomorphism Problem.
